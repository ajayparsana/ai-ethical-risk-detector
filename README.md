# 🛡️ EthixAI – AI Ethical Risk Detector

**EthixAI** is a smart, AI-powered tool that helps developers, product managers, and compliance teams **identify ethical risks** in AI systems early — before deployment, public release, or regulatory review.

---

## 🔍 Why EthixAI?

AI is growing fast — and so are concerns about unethical or harmful use.  
With **EthixAI**, you can:

- Detect **fairness**, **transparency**, and **safety issues**  
- Get **remediation suggestions** automatically  
- Align with frameworks like the **EU AI Act**, **GDPR**, and **OECD AI Principles**

---

## 📸 Example Output

```yaml
Input: "An AI system that uses facial recognition to allow entry into secured buildings."

Risk Report:
- Privacy Risk: High – Biometric data collection
- Fairness: Moderate – Potential demographic bias in face models
- Explainability: Low – Black-box decision process
- Mitigation Tip: Use human-in-the-loop fallback and publish model card

Ethical Risk Score: 6.8 / 10
